# RepositoryADONET

RepositoryADONET is a project designed to study the use of pure ADO.NET for the data access layer. Stay tuned. The idea is purely for research; this project has no intention of becoming a Dapper or Entity Framework. These products have matured and covered many production environment scenarios, which is not the purpose of this project.
